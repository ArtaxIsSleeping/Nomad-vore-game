	<name>great serpent</name>
	<description>A serpentine creature that must be at least 40 feet long
		from its tapering jaws all the way to the flare of long fur around its
		tailtip. Its body is crested along its entire length with long fur and
		its colour is the hue of a leaden grey sky. The rest of its body is
		covered in smooth near black charcoal hued hide. Beneath its two pairs
		of small birdlike or lizardlike legs grip the ground, they hardly seem
		to be any use for walking at that size but do help to stabilize that
		slender form. As you regard the thing it inevitably regards you in
		turn, forked tongue flicking out past stubby teeth as its radiant blue
		eyes meet yours and you feel your mind waiver.
