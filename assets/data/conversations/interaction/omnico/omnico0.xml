		subject: improper storage of synth accessories LBREAK 

		To the responsible parties, LBREAK 

		Please note that when not attached to the Omnico synthetic predator gynoid the class II genital attachment is to be stored safely in sub-level 2 storage area B. Furthermore they're to be contained  in a type-7 cargo box compliant with the standards for the preservation of flexible synth material.  LBREAK 

		It is not in fact appropriate to store them in an open topped plastic document tray perched precariously atop the door to Orrena's office. I should warn you that should you persist I will be forced to make some HR decisions. LBREAK 
		 
		I also should remind you that unlike our products I don't need an attachment for that, and I have space on my shelf for a 2 gallon jug. LBREAK

		Is it just me or are the latest batch of synths from head office kinda off. I can't put my finger on it, but something about the way they talk and look at me is freaking me out. Reminds me a tad too much of my last girlfriend, or the boss for that matter.

		I don't get it. We're setup in the ass end of nowhere. I mean, I get that we're technically on a trade route. But how many ships have passed by since I came here? And how many fewer bought any synths.
