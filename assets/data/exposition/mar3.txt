Bugs below and winged lizards above. Should of known the deposit was too good to be true. We're not leaving though, not yet. We've got a sonic barrier up around the base to keep the zappy lizards at bay and we've uncrated the heat rays for down below, bug armour ain't too good against being broiled alive. Kinda funny considering how hot their caves are really.
