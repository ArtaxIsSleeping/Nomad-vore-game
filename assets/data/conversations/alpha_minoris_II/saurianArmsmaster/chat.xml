	"Excellent, when you're ready we can begin" she says and smiles. <conditional>
				<assertion evaluate="slothasitem" slot="2" />"Though of course, a soldier has no other identity, you'll need to take off your clothes for your training" she says and waits for you to undress before they could get started.
			</conditional>
	"Now, a soldier must bring even their breathing into obedience. Sit down..close your eyes, and focus." she says, you hear her moving to stand in front of you as you obey. "now, breath in, breath out...slow deep breaths." she continues, letting you focus on the exercise for about a minute before adding "now, breath in, then open wide as you breath out."

	You open wide as instructed, exhaling only to find something abruptly filling your mouth as she continues quickly "A soldier must accept the unexpected, and in all things keep in mind what will please her superiors" says Varliss, as she slides more of her thick length past your lips and reaches a hand down to stroke through your hair. Your training taking a not unexpected lewd turn as your tongue is flooded with the musky taste of her shaft.

	Varliss seems to enjoy your obedience, or maybe just your tongue action, as a full throated moan emanates from deep within her and she rocks her hips, thrusting her length in and out of your mouth "Yes, I can see you understand the importance of serving to the..best of your abilities.." she says and then shivers a little and smirks "you really are quite good at this, or maybe you're just eager" she says as she grabs ahold of the back of your head and ploughs your throat.

	Varliss thrusts into your mouth firmly, vigorously using your lips and holding your head in place as she does so. Her hefty sack bumping up against your chin with each thrust she takes as her moans become louder and more delighted. As she feels her balls clench she speaks up again "A soldier must accept her reward readily when her superiors deem it fitting." she says, a warning of what's cumming soon.

	Forwarned you swallow as you feel her length pulse and pump the first thick wad of seed into your throat. Varliss groaning as she continues thrusting, spasming her hips and then finally stopping and just holding her dick deep in your mouth as she pumps out her seed. Only when she's pumped out her last spurt of seed does she pull out and smile "mhmm, obedient..I'll make a 'soldier' out of you yet." she says and helps you up "Training is over soldier, but come back again any time."

	Varliss tut tuts, but doesn't bring it up directly. she continues the breathing exercises for a time and then simply calls an end to it and as you get up smiles and chidingly taps you on the nose "Remember, a soldier, is obedient. No matter what" she says and then shoo's you off.

	"I can tell from your bearing, something about your stance. You haven't done it yet have you?" Varliss says with a soft hmm, looking you over and seeming to sense that you haven't yet slain that which is your task to slay.

Thin their numbers to stop this happening. Kill five and I'll be satisfied." she says and then leans in "And of course, do this and there will be a reward...and perhaps i could train you to be a soldier?" she says suggestively.
