			REPLAYING EXTERIOR CAMERA FOOTAGE FROM DESCENT LBREAK
			It looks like there's a rocky outcropping that's a different colour
			from the others near where you landed. Additionally there's some
			extensive ruins to the east and a large mountain southwest, though
			its sheer flanks would make it next to impossible to reach the
			summit. Most tantalizingly however a glimpse through the tree cover
			to the south east shows a stubby winged metal craft resting in the
			forest there. Assuming its a spacecraft then getting it to work might
			be your only chance to get off this rock.
