So you want to travel faster than light? unfortunately accelerating in a single direction won't get you to another star in a timely fashion. But luckily if you can procure a warp engine you to can travel at FTL speeds. This guide will provide a primer on the use of space warping engines for interstellar travel. Firstly of course you need an engine that provides space warping, all engines have an FTL rating. What it means we'll get to later but for now accept that each engine contributes to your ships FTL rating and higher ratings are better. You can use multiple engines though this will have diminishing returns. For truly great FTL speeds you will require multiple advanced space warping engines. LBREAK
You will require a source of energy to power the FTL engine, piping liquid fuels otherwise suitable for ship propulsion systems into warp engines will terminate their warranty in a very final way. If you have the engine and energy for a jump(You're advised to have full energy reserves) you merely need to select your destination. Simply position yourself between your host star and your destination star and access the navigation extension of your systems monitor. It will verify you have a valid flight path and if you do it will allow you to start charging the warper. Creating a warp bubble takes some time so you are advised to be far away from aggressive void fauna and hostile alien vessels. LBREAK
