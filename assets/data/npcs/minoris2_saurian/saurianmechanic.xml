	<name>Nissa</name>
	<description>A somewhat grubby saurian, her ochre scales tinged
		outright brown through lack of cleanliness and polish, so to her tunic
		is marked with stains, scorchmarks and frayed in places. Her black
		hair is tied tightly into a single long braid behind her and she wears
		two grossly over burdened belts of tools and knicknacks. She seems
		well at ease despite her stains though, fiddling with something or
		other.</description>
