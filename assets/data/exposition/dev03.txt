Log: So on the plus side, no harpies here. Unfortunately that's cause the goddamn robots shoot anything that moves. Don't seem to be trying to pursue me and I'm safe in here for now, thank god for slim Jess teaching me lockpicking, she was quite some gal, almost regret eating her now. Anyway, robots. Probably running some kinda pest control algorithm, just my luck if i get fried cause the metal heads thought i was some kinda oversized rodent. This'ere room has a charger, if i had anything that needed charging that'd be grand but my shooting iron only needs bullets of good brass. If I had an argon laser I could get some good mileage out of the thing. I can hear the metal bastards moving off, I'm gonna make a break for it. I figure I saw a rock formation to the west that indicates a place I can find Energist crystals, any luck whoever made this settlement carved a mine and it's not tapped out yet. I'll need those for fuel to get off this blasted rock.
