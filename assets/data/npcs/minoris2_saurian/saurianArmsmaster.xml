	<description>
	This saurian is clearly of some import and clearer still of a martial bent. She has the calluses and scars of an experienced warrior and the bearing of one used to command. She stands some six and a half feet tall, straight and proud and with one hand resting comfortably by the pommel of her sword. Her tunic appears comfortable and well made permitting a great deal of movement for her firm bodied feminine form, casting your gaze back up to meet her own you are struck by the pale whisps in her auburn hair, which is tied back into a ponytail..and by the way her icey blue eyes regard you, seemingly always on alert.
