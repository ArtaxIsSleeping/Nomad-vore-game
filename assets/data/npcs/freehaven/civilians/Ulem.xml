	<name>Ulem</name>
	<description>The diminutive figure before you stands a mere four foot tall but has the energy and good cheer of someone less pint sized. The most startling aspects of her beyond her demeanor though is her blue skin, fading to purple or even pinks in places and the fact that despite the paraphernalia of hair cutting in her possession such as scissors and combs she has no hair herself. In its place are tentacles, emerging from her scalp and draping down over her shoulders and back..some tentacles long enough to even reach her rear end, they move as if at least semi prehensile, twitching and curling and grasping. Two long 'bangs' ending in grasping pads seem to help her with whatever she's doing as extra hands.</description>
