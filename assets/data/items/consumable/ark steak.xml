	<description>A cooked, salted and preserved portion of meat from an arkosaur. Was once tough and full of gristle, now it looks at least edible.</description>

		The meat is somewhat bland, but is cooked well and is a decent size. You feel much more ready to take on the unknown after finishing your meal.
