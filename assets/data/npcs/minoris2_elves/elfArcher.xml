	<name>elf archer</name>
	<description>The greenskinned elf surveys her surroundings. At six foot she stands at least a little tall, her hair bound up with leather strands into multiple warlike braids and kept out of her eyes. While fetching, and as curvaceous as many other elves are, she's clearly a threat with an air of confidence to her that has nothing to do with the magnificence of her posterior. It probably has a lot more to do with the broad bow she's holding in skilled hands and the overfull quiver resting across her back. </description>
