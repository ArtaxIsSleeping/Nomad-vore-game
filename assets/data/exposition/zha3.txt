This is curious. Piecing together the murals on the walls near here they speak of heretics? unbelievers? rebels? who rose up against the god with swords that are depicted as glowing like the sun. The murals say they made their home amidst mountains to the west and did war with the faithful. They were defeated it seems, though their final act was to 'unearth a forgotten boat' and seek other unbelievers beyond the sky. Whatever that means it's clear that they did not succeed here, it speaks of how they were betrayed from within and all of them perished. Their boat is drifting in dark places now apparently. All very interesting. And our recent find in this very chamber proves the tale is not merely a myth but some form of history.
