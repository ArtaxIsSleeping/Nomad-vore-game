		There is more to the weapon arts than simple violence. Unlocks penetrating attack where you seek weaknesses in enemy defences to halve their defence against this attack, requiring S tagg'd weapon, and vigorous attack where you launch a flurry of attacks to overwhelm their ability to parry or dodge adding +6 to hit. both moves double AP cost.
