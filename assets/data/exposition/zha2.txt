..Pieced together something of the nature of this place from the murals. They speak of a mighty god who came to them from the stars and saved them from some calamity or other, this being is clearly physical as they speak of this place as its dwelling. The god is strangely not depicted. Though they speak of its rightness of will and its boundless appetites that must be appeased in a way that makes me somewhat uneasy.
