		You scan through the transfer log, mostly incoming specimen.
		As you scroll down you can find strange entries about
		material exchange with an AI operated research station. The name
		"Lazarus" appears over and over again... You also wonder why
		a science station would require such a massive amount of tungsten rods.

			You see black text pop up as you access the log:

			As you enter the password a list of missing personnel files pops up the terminal.
			However, one draws your attention due to the red blinking "live" symbol.
			Could it be? Someone is still alive out there?

			Your screen turns immediately dark as you turn on the live feed. 
			You first assumed that the system was malfunctioning, 
			but the camera interface clearly displays a blinking "live" in the upper corner of the interface. 
			In addition, you can hear a soft gurgle and sloshing emitting from the speakers. 
			You tap on the interface and countless options suddenly pop up.

			For a moment you see "manual override" written in green, pop up in the terminal screen, 
			before the screen flickers and suddenly springs to live, 
			it appears you just activated the cameras light function. You stare on the screen, 
			in an attempt to figure out what is going on. 
			The camera appears to be partially submerged and floating in what looks like white goo. 
			The screen shifts as the camera moves and spins in its creamy bath. 
			Every time the focus lens leaves the white goo you can see glistering pink flesh illuminated by the light. 
			Slowly you realize why this recording might have stayed active.

			You keep watching the camera floating in its slimy entrapment, 
			after a while your ears get more sensitive to the sloshing and gurgling sounds emitting from the speakers, 
			it is almost like you can hear a heartbeat. You stare at the screen, strangely fascinated by the camera, 
			floating like an airballoon, until you suddenly notice what looks like an id card in the background. 
			In a surge of surprise, you slap the interface with your bare hand, accidently activating the zoom trigger. 
			You see the camera zooming closer. The object is indeed an id card, you see a smiling face of a lizzardlike person. 
			Other then that you can read "supply manager" and an imprinted code "83391". 
			You try to find more informations but the card suddenly shifts and sinks into the white goo.
