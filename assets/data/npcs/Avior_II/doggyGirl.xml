	<name>doggy girl</name>
	<description>The doggy girl is a fetchingly curvy one. Her floppy brown ears might mark her as cute, as does her brown tail with its tendency to wag..but physically her shape especially her ample breasts and rounded posterior make her come across as sexy in a feral and predatory way. Her bare skin is only lightly tanned indicating she clearly spends most of the time under the tree canopy, and the way she's regarding you might indicate she'd prefer to spend some of that time with a belly full of you.</description>
