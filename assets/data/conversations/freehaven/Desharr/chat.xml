	Desharr takes your money and goes to the back to yell at someone, within a short time a plate of food is brought out and she plonks it down in front of you. Strange meats and ersatz vegetables are nevertheless tastey and filling when cooked and smothered in flavoursome sauces. Soon enough you've demolished the entirety of the plate.

	"Right you are." Desharr fills the mug and passes it to you. Tastes frothy but nice and zesty and not too strong, just helps you get buzzed and relaxed as you take your fill of it.

	"Coming up." she says and plants the shotglass down, pouring out a measure from a bottle she produces from under the counter as if by measure. She nudges it towards you. Desharr smiles benignly as you knock back the fiery mixture, it tastes like the end of sobriety crossed with being hit by a comet.
