<name>peasant</name>
<description>This lizard woman's stands nearly six feet tall, her body a mix of colours between an understated reddish orange ochre on her flanks, limbs, tail and back and an almost humanlike tan on her face and front. Though said from is by and large covered by a bland greyish tunic she's wearing that reaches from shoulder to mid thigh. The reptilian nature of the visage before you is emphasized by the scales on her ochre hued portions and the long tapering lizard tail anchored over her ass. You could probably get a good upskirt view with how the tail makes the tunic ride up, but such'd be awful rude of you.</description>
