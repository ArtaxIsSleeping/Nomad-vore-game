	<description>
	The golden skinned and orange scaled lizard girl before you has a pair of stubby horns, a tightly bound ponytail of her hair, small spectacles and a cream and tan business outfit that is formfitting enough to be as alluring as it is serious. She seems pre occupied with a computing device of some kind in her hands though, probably best not to interrupt her as she paces around.
