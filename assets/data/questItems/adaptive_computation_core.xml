An adaptive computation core, a heart of densely intermeshed and interwoven relays and logic gates far more than merely the sum of its parts. Its emergent capability derived from these many relays allow it to shift its calculation processes in real time to dynamically correct for dead end equations and NAN results. A powerful piece of technology indeed.
