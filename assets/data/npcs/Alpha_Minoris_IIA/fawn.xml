<description>The cute fawn girl is slender and small, barely four feet to the tips of her stubby horns. And the moment she notices your attention on her her deerish ears flick up and she's off and running, in a world like this creatures like her probably have little to protect themselves with except an ability to flee. her short tail atop her petite butt flicking in the breeze as she makes tracks away from you.</description>
