Gameplay concepts:

Health and resolve: Health determines your ability to resist being vored unwillingly (or otherwise meeting a bad end) resolve indicates your ability to resist the desire to become willing prey (or a willing plaything, or otherwise overcome with submissive lust) resolve automatically regenerates over time while healthy only regenerates at > 50% satiation (note this causes satiation to drop faster, so using health items might still be advantageous)

satiation: put simply, how close you are to starving. Satiation decreases over time, eat food or prey to become more satiated.

Action points: How much energy you have to use for attacks, moves, specials..etc. Recovers automatically. Recovers faster if doing things that aren't spending AP, recovers faster if over 50% satiation. The rate you regenerate action points scales with your action point maximum total.

Karma meter: Your predator/prey balance. Determines the nutritional benefit of each source, switches cannot get the full benefit of either normal food or prey where as obviously those at each extreme can get the most of it.

Bad ends and player victory: A bad end scene will be enacted by any enemy who reduces the player to 0 resolve or 0 health, which may end the game if the player lacks the skills or luck to escape their clutches. Additionally enemies who are defeated(red background) or seduced(pink background) can be interacted with to enact some debauchery upon those who they've beaten.

Autosave: the game autosaves each time you transition between zones in the slot marked 'autosave'

Levelling up and experience: Defeating npcs and gaining quest rewards can give you experience you can use to level up. When you level up your stats increase, you get to raise a skill by 1 and every other level you can select a perk.
