<entry name="TK: Ion Bow">
	<text>
	The Ion bow is an anachronistic weapon combining ancient stylistic principles with advanced technology. The clip fed crossbow mechanism launches bolts that use a small battery cell to generate an ion envelope. Friction with the atmosphere only increases the charge levels until the bolt impacts the target discharging the electrical energy in a sudden burst. This burst can stun targets briefly allowing a skilled user to bring down a foe with repeated shots while their opponent is unable to retaliate. Some may call it an elegant weapon of a more civilized age, others may call it 'cool', but either way an ion bow could be a useful addition to your arsenal.
