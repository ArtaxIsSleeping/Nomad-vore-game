			You attempt to extract the computational parts of the robot intact but
			your lack of skill just leads to you breaking them in an inept attempt
			to rip them out. They're useless now, but at least you have a few
			wires and chunks of the robot's casing as souvenirs. Or maybe they can
			be paperweights, or raw material for future use.

			You attempt to extract the delicate computation valves. The devices take
			a careful touch to extract from the surrounding systems but your steady
			your hands and manage to successfully extract two computation valves
			from the robot's brain, so to speak. To celebrate, you dismantle some of its
			wiring and casing for some additional raw materials.

			You think you should try and extract the robot's weapon system, 'cause everything is
			better with lasers. Alas you're not as capable of that as you think you are
			and the robot's combination sensor and laser focusing optics is reduced
			to uselessness by your fumbling.

			Looking at the robot's head, it's probably not possible to
			extract the laser system whole-cloth in any fashion that would be
			convenient or even possible to weild, but some elements may
			still be valuable. You set about dismounting the optical lenses and mirrors
			from inside the robot's otherwise empty head and soon enough, you have
			some relatively intact optical components for future use.
