			You lodge the bomb at the base of the rock fall, lit the fuse and then
			ran well clear. The blast was deafening, pulverizing the rock to
			powder and clearing the pass. Though the sound of it will surely have
			been heard for many miles, the newly accessable path will not remain
			secret for any time at all.
