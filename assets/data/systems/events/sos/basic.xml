	You hear a series of thuds and groans as something impacts the ship and latches on, with mounting dread you hear it shift its mass along the exterior towards the hatch. As it does so you hear a series of loud beeps from the nav console as the SOS is disrupted by the terrible presence. The airlock letting out a screeching wail of alarms and over burdened mechanisms as something horrifying forces its way aboard.
