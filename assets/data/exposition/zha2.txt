..Pieced together something of the nature of this place from the murals. They speak of a mighty god who came to them from the stars and saved them from what appears to be a second star in their skies in this depiction though I am unsure what this might mean. This being that saved them is clearly physical as they speak of this place as its dwelling and speaking of it ruling over them directly. No clear depictions of the deity remain on the murals, those parts are curiously more damaged than the rest. Though they do speak of its rightness of will and its boundless appetites that must be appeased in a way that makes me somewhat uneasy.
