	<description>A pair of long green ears emerge from the tousled mess of
		hair atop the head of this alien villager, decorated in all manner of
		gaudy earrings. Much like others of her kind she has a simply smashing
		ass, but whereas the others were all bottom this one seems to have a
		bust to match. Clearly dressed to show off these added assets, the
		front of her robe strains to contain her cleavage, you think she might
		have altered the front to be just a bit too small on purpose. Said
		robes are lined with several pockets and bound on sacks full of
		assorted items. Combined with the items in her immediate vicinity she
		has quite a stock and the air of someone who would trade parts of it
		to visitors for the right price. </description>
