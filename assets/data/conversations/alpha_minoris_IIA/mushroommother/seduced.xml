		The mother of these mushrooms lies on her back, overwhelmed

		Those orbs look so heavy on her. You think you oughtta lighten the load,
		so, ignoring or not suffering of lactose intolerance (if her milk even has lactose in it),
		you get down on your knees beside her pudgy, pacified form and wrap
		your arms around the breast closest to you, taking a second to really
		appreciate how soft they are. They're like water balloons you could fit
		a person inside! Then, licking you lips, you lean forward and fit the
		nozzle of her bottlecap nipple in your mouth. And man, is the elixir
		ever delightful. Warm, sweet, a little earthy. It's... intoxicating.
		Not literally, but you know. And it sounds like the mother's getting
		some enjoyment out of this, too.

		Alright, let's not get carried away. You've still got plenty of stuff
		on your schedule. Your lips make a popping sound when you pry them from
		her nipple. The mother isn't the happiest that you gotta bounce, but
		that's her issue.

		You didn't need to tell you twice. You aren't stepping away from this
		teat until you're damn ready to. You're not even nearly full. And the
		mother hasn't gotten her fill of enjoyment out of this either, her cooing
		getting louder and louder. The taste doesn't get old-- hell, you might
		say it's getting better with every drop. It's... it's heavenly. It beats
		out all the swill you used to call booze, or soda, or juice, or water...
		What's it even made of? Your head feels too funny to think about that.

		You can't help it. You can't have enough. Not while you're still outside.
		You pop your mouth from her nipple and jam your fingers through the opening,
		prying it wide open for your head to fit through. Soon, you've wormed your
		shoulders, your collar, and your breasts through the opening, but you got stuck
		at the waist as your feet left the ground. The fungal mother is happy to help you
		the rest of the way through, though, sweetie, with a hand on your ass to
		finish the job, nipple slapping wetly shut behind you. And so you're left to

		Suddenly your brow furrows in realization: you're getting hit by pheromones.
		They're all around you like a curtain of smoke. You must not have noticed
		while you were busy engorging yourself on her milk. Immediately, you push
		yourself off of her, gulp down the rest of what's in your mouth, cover your
		lower face, and put some distance between the two of you, much to the mother's
		disappointment. Well, at least you filled your belly.

		Focus. It's good, but not worth losing your mind over. And you've had plenty
		of good drinks before. You're sure they could be improved with her milk, but
		it's not worth forsaking them over. Like, what was that dumb shit you thought
		about water being swill? It's fucking water. There's like a cosmic rule out
		there that drinking-water cannot be swill. In any sense. Anyways, you've had...

		You give her teat one last gulp

		away. The mother tries to pull you back in with a swipe of the arm but she's
		too weak to succeed, saying, "Come back! Don't you want more?~" It falls on
