It takes but a moment for her to notice you and she taps a button and carelessly tosses the device to one side bounding up as she shifts gear in the span of a breath and unleashes smiling cuteness on you "Nyah welcome to Robyn's emporium of general goods and supplies. I'm Robyn the proprietor and how can I help you today?"
