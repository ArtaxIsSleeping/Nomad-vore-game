Log: Thank fuck for fucking parachutes is all i gotta say...
Bastarding thing went down like a meteor, if I'da not jumped I'd be girl'puddin' by now and I still had to trek a'ways to get to the crash site. and of course the bloody cargo container survived the crash and is jammed closed, ship smashed to bits and the box with most of my stuff is solid as a rock. Still small favours, this valley is pretty fertile and the fruit on these'er bushes look edible. So least ways I won't goddamn starve. 'Nough break though, nearly got the box open.
The fuck is that sound?
