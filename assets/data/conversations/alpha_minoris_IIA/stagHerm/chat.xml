			The stag demi looks both at once innocent and shameless. You can see
			she's unfamiliar with her surroundings and with you, her inexperience clear in
			her eyes. But on the other hand with that innocence she has no shame to cover that shaft
			of hers. Your new pet flaunting that hefty dangling length as she looks down at
			you "....hello?" she asks uncertainly, reaching out one hand to touch your face as if to confirm this is a real world.

	"You made me, but i have memories..or at they dreams.." luckily the stagherm seems to disregard any remnants of her life as a fawn. She smiles uncertainly "You are PNAME and you made me, but what did you make me for?"

	"OH, well.. I see." she seems uncertain how to react to an explaination like that "Well, I'm glad you'll want to keep me around now. I'm sure I can be good." she says and then headtilts "Though if you're PNAME ? then who am I?" she asks, leaning forward intently.

	"oh umm, well. I don't know much about how to play..that way." she says and then follows how you're looking at her "but maybe you'll teach me?" she says before adding "But i don't want to just be called playmate.. you have a name, can i have a name?"
