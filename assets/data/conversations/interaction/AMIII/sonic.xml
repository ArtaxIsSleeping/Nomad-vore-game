			this device is clearly intended to project a sonic barrier
			around a large area, possibly to keep wildlife away. It's been badly
			damaged due to the destruction of the emitter array. But a flux
			capacitor can be extracted from the wrecked machinery intact if you
			want to do that.

			You extract the flux capacitor, in doing so you're forced to
			dismantle much of the remaining machinery to safely extract it.
