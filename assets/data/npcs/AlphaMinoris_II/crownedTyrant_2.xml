	<name>Crowned tyrant</name>
	<description>
	This humanoid anthropomorphic dinosaur looms eight feet tall not even including her horns. Her long and broad jawed toothsome head is crowned with six spreading horns that curve upwards from her skull. Her snout having the air of a tyranosaur more than an alligator and constantly those door like jaws are resting agape as she breathes. Her body itself is a mix of the primal and alluring, built with a broad and muscular frame that speaks of unstoppable power she nonetheless has a magnificent rack and full thighs. Her entire form from claws to tail is covered in scales that range from thin over her front to thick and broad on her back and across her limbs.
