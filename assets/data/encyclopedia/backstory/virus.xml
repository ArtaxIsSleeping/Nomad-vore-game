		You've studied several non verbal alien species and come to some disturbing
		conclusions as a result. These non verbal species share the traits of
		having atrophied sections of their brain dealing with language and
		abstract thought. Without these areas fully functional they're reduced
		to a form of savagery, unable to progress beyond primitive
		vocalizations and body language and without the ability to use tools.
		The condition is horrifying to contemplate.
		LBREAK
		However worse still is the implication of the widespread nature and
		commonality of the effects. This was clearly intentional, some form of
		virus has inflicted genetic damage on multiple species without regards
		to zoonotic barriers which could only be plausible if it was an
		engineered bio weapon. It's clear that this bio engineered plague
		ravaged at least this part of the galaxy, it may explain the presence
		of ruins and the lack of an organized interstellar civilization in the
		present despite hints of one in the past.
		LBREAK
		who unleashed the plague and why is unclear, but it may be possible to
		reverse its effects in some circumstances.
