With an almost comical herky jerky motion the synth lowers itself down over her fallen fellow. The synth's lips hover over that of the other, and then crank open as her jaws lever wide. The synth then lunges forwards with a jerk, engulfing the other synth's unresponsive head and swallowing, starting to tug the limp doll like form of the downed synth down her throat.

The Synth works her lips down over her fallen comrade without resistance. Her body stretching over the shape of her fellow and bulging out as she starts to cram the gynoid into her belly. As she reaches the thighs of the synth though there's an abrupt spasm from the formerly inert fellow she's devouring. The synth's legs spasming and twitching as mechanized tendrils begin to stretch out from inside the jaws of the cannibalistic gynoid.

The synth finishes gobbling up the other one. Her jaws snapping shut behind the twitching toes of the synth. Barely does the spasming doll have a chance to settle in the belly of the other before that spasming begins to extend to the rest of the synth.

The synth's body cracks, technological cilia emerging from rents in her artificial skin and her body spasming now as random buzzes and beeps emerge amidst the insect like sounds of her internal geometry forcibly reassembling. First one, then another of the encased synth's arms erupt from the flanks of the cannibalistic synth's body.

<text>
The synth's body assumes a more animalistic posture as her additional arms finish anchoring and her belly bulge diminishes. No longer a synth, but something else..something similar and yet different. Synth like, synthoid...and far more dangerous.
