fragmentary log: We've come into dock to the derelict, some suggested we'd be better served with the planet below but the natives likely have nothing of value where as the ship in orbit has an interplanetary reactor according to our scans. Be a score for the Diarchy if we could bring back that tech from this little trip, records say the things gave a dramatic increase in fuel efficiency. It's no proton cannon but increased range and an ease of the logistical burden for the fleet is nothing to sneer at... the squad has gone over, nothing to do but wait and monitor comms.
