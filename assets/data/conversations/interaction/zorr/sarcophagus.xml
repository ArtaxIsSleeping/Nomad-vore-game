			As you open the sarcophagus the figure's eyes snap open and she shoves
			the lid off the rest of the way. Each eye glinting a dull green hue
			as they dart around. The figure lurching upright as tattered feathery
			wings spread behind her and she turns to look at you. She seems
			confused for several moments, only for that to give away to
			confliction as she shudders and stops herself as she reaches for the
			blade scabbarded at her waist. But it seems her internal battle is
			swiftly lost as she pulls the blade free and her gaze locks onto you
			"stay away" she whispers almost pleadingly, even as she steps out of
			the sarcophagus and onto the attack.
