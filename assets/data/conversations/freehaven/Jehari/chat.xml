	Jehari turns around when you get her attention "Ah! you're back, yes?" she pauses a moment then nods "Yes, you're back. Sorry sometimes it's hard to keep things straight. What can I do for you today?"

	"Oh excellent, good I'll just take that and.." she takes the core and inserts it into a computer she'd somehow had the foresight to prepare earlier, then looks to you blankly "What did we need it for again?" she asks and seems to not remember for a distressing second "Oh right..uh, black box data. Do you want me to start processing that now?" she asks smiling and holding one hand in the other as she looks to you.

	"What processing are you..oh." says Jehari glancing around and her gaze rests on her new shiny computer and she smiles a moment before leaning in to examine it more "No, no it doesn't look like it is. Come back later." she says and turns back to you and rubs her hands together "Come back later. Have I already said that?"

	"What processing? oh yes, yes! It's done." she says and goes and grabs a print out from the shiny computer "Here you go..oh and thankyou for the core. Have to remember that, have to remember to tell you that." she says as she proffers the print out towards you.

	"Fascinating though really. Your vessel came from somewhere in the system at coordinates -1,-1. Without a warp engine it must of taken decades at least to land where it did." says Jehari as you look at the same thing she's telling you, only on the printout. Jehari has added a helpful summary of all the vector math to that effect "I have thanked you for the core haven't I? it will be very useful for my research"

	"Oh was that her name? she didn't tell me..or maybe she did. Yes we have the core right here." she says and pats a freshly modified computer. Then she looks perplexed "What did we need it for again?" she asks and stares blankly at you for a distressing second "Oh right..uh, black box data. Do you want me to start processing that now?" she asks smiling and holding one hand in the other as she looks to you.

	The reptile taur is contemplatively musing to herself, seemingly deep in consideration of..something on her datapad only to look up saying something inscrutably technical to herself and darting over to a scanner and from there shortly to rummage in a cabinet all without noticing your presence. Just about the time you were starting to wonder whether it was a good idea to disturb her though she seems to catch a glimpse of you out of the corner of her eye and lets out a startled mip, the heavy taur jumping in surprise "Oh! I didn't see you there...you, how long have you been standing there, you didn't see me...no you don't look like you did. Uh, why are you here?"

	Jehari brightens up "Oh may I see?" she asks with a worryingly toothsome smile, but she really is harmless right? "Don't worry, I won't damage it...just." she accepts the black box and after a minute or so has it hooked up and reading to a screen. Her attention seems to wander briefly once that's done.

	"Oh..oh!" she snaps her attention back to the screen and then frowns "Well..yes..and no..the calculations of gravitational influences are quite complex and.." she turns back to you and wringes her hands together apologetically "I am afraid due to my, condition, I would be quite unable to focus long enough to complete them."

	"Oh, oh well I suppose it is..not just that. Mostly it's my lab, but Frei says I need to pay for a place on this level. So yes, i sell things, that makes this is a shop right? probably. Are you interested in being sold things?" she cants her head to the side.

My people are all grown in vats, we were originally meant to be soldiers for our makers but they were seemingly all reduced to less than full sapience by the plague so we had to create our own leaders and goals with no one to tell us what to do. I think we mostly lack imagination though, fighting and conquering was what we were doing before we were free."
