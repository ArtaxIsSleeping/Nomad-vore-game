	<name>wild lamia</name>
	<description>An intimidatingly large lamia woman. Her dark green tail
		as thick as a tree trunk, and could possibly be as long as one as
		well, but it was hard to tell with how sporadically winded up her body
		was. Long brown hair draped messily over her bare chest, hardly able
		to cover her sizable breasts. Everything about her screamed 'feral',
		be it the lack of clothes, the snakelike movement, and the way her
		attention locked onto every little detail in the forest around her.
		She was very clearly in hunt mode, and must have had quite the hunger
		to sate.</description>
