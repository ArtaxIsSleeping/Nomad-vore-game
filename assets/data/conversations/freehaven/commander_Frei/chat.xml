	Upon entering the station for the first time it seems you have a welcome of sorts. A somewhat buxom but serious seeming woman with a pair of white bunny ears extending from amidst her blonde hair and all of that shapelyness is wrapped in a blue uniform jumpsuit "Greetings stranger, I figure seen as this is your first time on Free Haven I'd make sure we'd be seeing eye to eye."

	"Fairly simple, just cause this is a free port and we got no one in charge doesn't mean we got no laws. No stealing, no assault, no grabbing someone and scarfing them down. Make no trouble and there's a place for you, make trouble and well..there's a different place for you and you ain't gonna like it." she says and glances down meaningfully possibly indicating her belly or possibly something lower.

	Frei chuckles "Then I suppose we'll let it slide. Sides, some traders are kinda into that sorta thing. And the smart ones of those have reformers. So yeah, we see any signs of a struggle or a cry for help and we'll come running and angry. Beyond that, have fun."

	"I'm gonna assume you're asking this rhetorically but fine I'm game." says Frei, straightening one of her ears with a calculating expression "The reason we got these laws is cause we're a spacestation, we get few enough traders as it is and funny enough traders like to be able to do their trading without ending up on some gangers thighs."
