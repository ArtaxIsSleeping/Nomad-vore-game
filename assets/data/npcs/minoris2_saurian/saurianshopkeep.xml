	<description>The saurian has a certainly more vivid orange in her
		scales than other females. Less ochre and more the colour of the
		fruit, least from what you can see outside her robe. She smiles up at
		your arrival in her humble shop. A low display table before her seated
		form upon which many things to sell are laid out. She doesn't rise
		from her seated position on the pillow but there's a pillow across
		from her, its clear any conversations will be had at her level. </description>
