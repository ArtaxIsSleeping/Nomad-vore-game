			As you all know the ship from head office is now overdue. I'm keeping
			the comm open to try and flag down passing traffic to pass on a
			message of inquiry to head office but so far interstellar traffic
			appears to have taken a nose dive. It is however nothing to worry
			about, our stock and supplies will last a considerable amount of
			time. Especially with the lack of passing customers.

			RE: preventing accidents LBREAK

			I'm going to prevent the recent glitches involving the synth safeties
			are down to maintenance or defects rather than actual foul play for
			the time being. However it has become clear I need a contingency in
			place unless I want to explain to head office how I'm down half the
			staff due to the synths getting gurgle happy. As such I've pulled
			some strings to get us a reformation tube. It'll be locked in the
			back of the storage level unless the main computer detects synth's
			without their safeties. This is to stop you lot using it
			recreationally which I know you would do, and probably still will do
			despite my best efforts. Just remember I can blank patterns and I
			have a space on my shelf.
