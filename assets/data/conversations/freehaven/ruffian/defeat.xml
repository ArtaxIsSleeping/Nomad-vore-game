		The wolfgirl's lost some pride and more importantly her bat after her defeat. She growls as you approach her, staggering to her feet with difficulty and swaying "Don't be looking at me like that, I ain't done yet." she says, despite evidence to the contrary and the way a gentle push could knock her over.

	"I ain't food! why you, I oughtta..come here so i can." she starts, and doesn't get to finish as indeed you do come here..but only to grab her arm, haul her forwards, grab her head and then guide the weakened wolfy headfirst into your mouth. Her protests nicely muffled as you stretch your lips around  her skull, matting her hair and ears against her noggin as you encompass her head entirely and take your first swallow. Her struggles are quite lively, but that yelp from in your throat as she slides through your neck makes it clear that even the rambunctious and confident wolf is realizing she's in hot water.

	The ruffian struggles against your voracious mouth and throat encompassing more and more of her body but to no avail. Your hungry swallows tugging her down into the depths of your belly as she yank her pants and boots off of her to make her go easier on your digestive process. For her life of crime this wolfy is about to get her just desserts as you swallow your way down to her rump and take in that ample ass of hers. Her kicking legs angling towards the ceiling above you as you prepare to cram her all the way down into your growing gut bulge.

		The wolfgirl growls as she's pushed against the bottom and front of your gut forming bulges in the shape of her hands and her face visible from outside. She's still putting up a commendable fight despite her predicament and the way her legs are disappearing past your lips. "When I get out of here I'm going to show you who's the boss." she threatens, even as you snap your jaws shut past her feet and condemn her entirely to your gut.

	"I am not about to get digested I'm getting out here" she retorts and then promptly yelps as your enzymes contradict her by spilling in from the fleshy walls. Your stomach starting to gurgle and churn around her as she struggles and squirms mightily to try and force her way back out. Unfortunately for the wolfy girl she's no match for your gut, and though your belly jostles, sways and bounces with her movements the end was never in doubt. Your stomach grinding her down until finally those growls turn to whimpers and those struggles turn to twitches and glorps..and then after that, nothing but smoothly liquid gurgles emanate from inside you as she breaks down. The wolfy turned into naught but a thick gooey mass inside you that your body all too readily and easily absorbs.
