			A mission terminal, this one controls function of a research satellite called "Lazarus". 
			It seems like someone was working on some kind of authorization process and stopped in the middle of it. 
			The terminal asks you to place your hand on a scan device to proceed.

			You place your flat palm on the device as instructed and wait for a reaction. 
			Suddenly you feel your hand heat up, you try to remove it but an invisible forcefield keeps it in place. 
			Before you get the chance to panic, you feel the heat vanishing again, as the contraption releases your palm.
			The screen shows you that you just gained access to some of Lazarus subroutines.
