			The stag demi looks both at once innocent and shameless. You can see
			she's unfamiliar with her surroundings and with you, her inexperience clear in
			her eyes. But on the other hand with that innocence she has no shame to cover that shaft
			of hers. Your new pet flaunting that hefty dangling length as she looks down at
			you "....hello?" she asks uncertainly, reaching out one hand to touch your face as if to confirm this is a real world.

	"You made me, but i have memories..or at they dreams.." luckily the stagherm seems to disregard any remnants of her life as a fawn. She smiles uncertainly "You are PNAME and you made me, but what did you make me for?"

	<text>
	"OH, well.. I see." she seems uncertain how to react to an explaination like that "Well, I'm glad you'll want to keep me around now. I'm sure I can be good." she says and then headtilts "Though if you're PNAME ? then who am I?" she asks, leaning forward intently.

	"oh umm, well. I don't know much about how to play..that way." she says and then follows how you're looking at her "but maybe you'll teach me?" she says before adding "But i don't want to just be called playmate.. you have a name, can i have a name?"

	Eve blinks and then uncertainly moves forwards to embrace you, wrapping you in the warmth of her arms. When you snug her back she loses any hesitancy and mhmms, pulling you closer and pressing her soft breasts and her girth against your body happily "MHmm, I think I like you." she says with a smile, holding you tight for a minute afore you disentangle yourself from her.
	</text>
	<choice destination="end" text="$And I like you as well, I'll be back later to talk to you more"/>

	Eve looks around then looks down at her magnificent body then back to you and nods uncertainly "If you say so..i remember being, small." she says and shifts posture obliviously setting that length asway.
	</text>
	<choice destination="end" text="$Yes, you have a lot to get used to. I think I'll give you time to do so."/>
