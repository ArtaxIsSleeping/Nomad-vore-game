			The pump is broken and in need of repair. The mechanisms appear to have

			You skillfully fashion a series of replacement parts from the fragments
			of wiring, metal and electronic components you have on hand and place
			them into the engine. Sealing it up again you're confident the device
			will function now, you should probably tell Nissa so you can both try
			it together.

		<text>
			You attempt to replace the damaged components, but your crude fumbling
			and incompetent bungling only succeed in ruining perfectly good wires
			and mangling metal fragments beyond any reasonable use. You're fairly
			sure you've not repaired the engine, and that you've wasted the
			materials used in the attempt. Nothing but the risk of further damage
			to your own pride stops you making the attempt again though if you
			had more materials.
