	<name>raptor huntress</name>
	<description>The raptor huntress casts her gaze over you and sizes you up, she seems a cut above the regular raptors. She shares their sleek athletic physique, though maybe has an inch or two in height over the younger sort. Her body is mostly covered in reddish brown scales though she's daubed herself in places with smears of some yellow substance giving her a few streaks on her scales and a more tribal air. She retains the exposure of her tanned skin on her hands, feet and much of the front of her torso and the insides of her thighs. And of course, no raptor would be complete without that reptilian tail and a set of prominent claws which you can only assume she knows how to use. She seems to cock her head to the side as she finishes her assessment of you around the time you do yours, letting out a chirping call that is answered by other voices nearby..this cannot bode well.</description>
