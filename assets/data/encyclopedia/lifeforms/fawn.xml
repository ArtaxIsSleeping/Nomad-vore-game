		Description: LBREAK
		Deer-girls, or, colloquially, fawns, are diminutive humanoids with cervine
		attributes, such as stubby horns, deer ears, and a short tail. Even older
		specimens retain similar short, slender and youthful appearances, thus the
		misleading colloquialism. No specimens have been observed to show the degree
		of endowment or facial roughness that would, in humans, signify adult age.
		Additionally, no specimen thus far has been observed to demonstrate the
		ability to produce articulate speech, despite other visible intellectual
		faculties.
		LBREAK
		Biological findings: LBREAK
		It's unclear how fawns reproduce as they appear to unerringly only possess
		the ovarian sex. Biological analysis, however, indicates a complicated
		sequence of latent instructions in an inactive sexual chromosome.
		This sequence would appear to cause a metamorphic cascade in the fawn,
		though it is unclear at this point what sort of natural event or substance
		would activate this DNA. However this does not preclude the possibility of
		synthesizing the necessary trigger proteins and injecting them into a
		contained specimen. It is not, however, clear at this juncture what the
		result of this experiment would be or if there would be any side effects.
		LBREAK
		Tactical assessment: LBREAK
		The fawn's lack of developed musculature outside their legs
		coupled with their naturallyy timid disposition makes them no physical
		threat whatsoever. They lack the forward nature to be assertively
		seductive due to their aforementioned disposition and so are no
		psychological threat either. As they will flee confrontation, the use
		of ranged assault or mobility restriction is recommended in order to
		incapacitate them.
