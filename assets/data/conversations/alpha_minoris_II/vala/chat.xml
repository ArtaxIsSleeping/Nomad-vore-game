		The stoic elven woman glares at you as you enter, sheathing her sword and standing up to greet you. "Hail outsider, I was at the ceremony. You have decided to join us in our fight against those reptilians. Although I won't pretend to understand your strange devices, it is an undeniable fact you've helped our village with it's troubles. Hence I must ask you this. Have you need of a warrior on your journey? I find myself lacking, and perhaps an adventure is what I need to continue to grow."

			An elven warrior sits on a bed in the corner of the room, polishing and inspecting a blade. She looks wary and alert, amber eyes flitting about restlessly. Her long ears twitch as if she listening to something far away. Looking you over, she grunts. 
			"Hmph. I'm not willing to associate with some outsider, go bother someone else."

		Vala's expression is one of incredulity as she wordlessly watches your approach.
		Shaking, she stammers out some gasping inaudible words, before clearing her throat and speaking.
		"PNAME. Tell me this is no space or magic prank. ...I must have finally lost it."

		"Don't speak apparation. Look."
		Vala turns around, cocking her hips towards you. Her improved booty bounces slightly, much tighter in her pants than before.
		"Proof of your digestion. ..Care to explain?"
		When she turns back, the shocked relief on her face is immediately apparent. She smiles at you, but locks eyes unblinking, seemingly worried you'll disappear if you leave her sight for even a split-second.

		You take the time to explain the reformer and it's basic functionality to Vala, and more importantly, register her into the system. She still doesn't really believe it possible, but when you're done, she grabs you and squeezes you into a hug. Sniffling, she holds you for a decent amount of time, before becoming awkward. Right after breaking contact, she tugs on both ears at once. Maybe she'll be interested in offering herself up now that, in her words, she's 'One of the immortal gods'? You hope she doesn't just use it as an excuse to throw herself at the strongest beasts imaginable for training. The determined fire in her eyes says she intends to do just that. Oh boy...

		Looking a little surprised, Vala scratches her behind her ear and begins hesitantly. 
		"Myself? Well.. Hmm.. I was trained by my mothers in sword and spearmanship."
		She stops, shrugging exaggeratedly; you can tell she is embarrassed.
		"There is not much else to say. Not many care for other's life stories in Minyos.. Give me some time. I will think about it more carefully, so as not to disappoint you again."

		It's been some time before you asked Vala about herself, maybe she'll answer now. Her expression however, says otherwise.
		"Look PNAME, I know what I said last time. I'm just not sure I can trust you. Usually learning more about someone is to grasp their less obvious weaknesses. How about this then? Uhhh.. Hmm. My favourite food is roasted deku nut salad. I admire strength. I dislike losing. Good enough?"
		You open your mouth to speak but Vala cuts in before you have the chance.
		"Okay. I can see you may want to know more. I'll share it with you once I know you're entirely trustworthy. Sorry."
		She nods then walks away, tugging at an ear.

		She sighs loudly. 
		"...Alright, alright." 
		Vala, looking uncharacteristically sheepish, takes a deep breath and prepares herself to speak. 
		"Look, I wasn't always like this. So stiff. Formal. So on edge." 
		She gestures to herself while continuing, 
		"I was like everyone else in Minyos. ...Hedonistic. You know, thinking more about gulping acquaintances than becoming closer friends with them. It was beaten out of me by my mother. She used to be nice once. Is this really the sort of thing you want to know? Some sob story? It's not like it's that uncommon. I'm lucky to have even known my parents!"
		You can see she doesn't want to talk. She sighs again.

		"My mother.. returned from a hunt one day. She entered our home to find her pregnant wife splattered all over the place. A ...cooling mess. Not too out of the ordinary around here, and many hunters don't even make it home to find their family gone. But.. It broke her, I think. They seemed so happy together."
		Vala looks into the distance wistfully for a moment, but shakes her head. Her voice broke slightly as she continued. 
		"The thought that it could have been consensual was probably too much for her to take. It could have been anyone. Mother wasn't about to go out on a revenge massacre or anything, but she changed that day." 
		Vala inhales and exhales deliberately. 
		"She left that old house as it was and spent all she had to build a fenced off house on the outskirts of town."

		Vala looked at the ground, ears drooping.
		"That day, my friends and I were fighting with our rival group, four or five girls a side. The feud had come to a head and most were eaten right there. Truthfully, I don't remember what the disagreement was even about. Returning home with a girl-filled stomach was a mistake I had no way of knowing I had made. My parents normally laughed it off, maybe teased a bit, but Mother was in no laughing mood. ...The things she said, I'm sure she regretted. But.. Being young and having the one you respect the most go so far.."
		Voice trailing off, Vala breathes deeply and evenly, calming herself.
		"From then on, I was trained extensively. No friends or freedom. Certainly no more live meals. Mother was an expert with the spear, she ruthlessly beat me down day after day. I wanted to leave, alas, not many could stand up to mother in battle. None would help me even when begged. Especially as she wouldn't hesitate to kill, and usually in brutal fashion. ..It was hard. Many times I ran, but she would drag me back and add more to the training. Looking back on it now, at least I got to spend so much time with her."

		"Without warning, she gave me a final test, to prove myself worthy of her teaching. Worried about the meaning of 'final' I was scared. Afraid of her leaving. Afraid of disappointing her.. Nevertheless, I passed. I inherited my deceased mother's sword, the only thing Mother had kept from that old house. 
		Vala spoke fondly of the memory, but you could hear anger breaking though. 
		"I thought she would be proud. But years of bitterness seemed to trump any other feelings she may have once had. Now believing me to be of sufficient strength, she kicked me out. Years of toiling, and she kicked me out. Without words of praise. Without words of abuse. Nothing."
		Vala had balled her fists tight enough to draw blood. Her nails pushed through even her firm calloused palms.  
		"Mother left on an expedition soon after, with the scholar Zhan. None returned."
		Inhaling through her nose, Vala trembled and grit her teeth.

		"I wish she had just talked to me. Told me why! Told me anything! Taken me with her!? What was it all for if she just goes off and dies?! I just...! And now look at me! Just like her! Alone and.."
		Tears welling up as she got flustered, Vala spat out words like she was removing poisonous bile from within.
		"Why train me so hard for so long!? Why scare away my friends?! Why! Nothing is even out here! Every day was the same! Torture that never ended! Torture from her. Torture from those gossiping, gluttonous, sex-addicts! I hate her.. Yet why do I still follow her words to the letter! I lived in that house alone and continued to train! I push away all advances and distance myself! Can I even change?! Tell me PNAME, what do I do!? What can I do?!"
		She grabs your arm, looking at you frantically, in plea for an answer.

		Vala slumps to the ground, tears slowly running down her cheeks, staring at her mother's sword. She sits silently for a minute. You've never heard her speak this much. The quiet pause breaks, she speaks softly, more to herself than you.
		"What do I want..? I've always wanted to join the others again.. Eating and fucking without much regard.. I've been taught to be ashamed of our tendancies. I still respect Mother. I don't want to betray her teachings but.. Every instinct tells me she was wrong. Can something so good, really be so bad?"
		Speaking louder now, she draws her sword, rubbing her hand over the flat of the blade.
		"Okay. I want to be useful. More than being a meal or as an orgasm.. I want to us to triumph over the lizards and let our people prosper. Make our village into something bigger. Better, more grand. If we had the resources, there'd be no fear of losing your family with every hunt. With star technology like yours, no one would be trapped like I was.."

		She thinks for a while, suddenly looking up and nodding.
		"PNAME, you've shown me much. I couldn't imagine anything other than this jungle. But now I have a goal. I cannot think of another way to show my gratitude other than this. I pledge myself to you. I want to help you. I've decided. I'll remember my mother, but surpass her and move on. She wouldn't want me to stay closed off and miserable any more than she wanted me to be eaten, I'm sure. She tried, in her own way, to protect me. I know now."
		Closing her eyes and murmuring some sort of prayer, she slowly sheathes the sword. Finished, she looks back to you, sniffling a little. 
		"Whatever your goal, I will stand by your side. When we are done, I will bring technology to my people and then work to improve everyone's lives. I don't want to live in regret any longer. I swear it."
		Vala stands up, saluting you, amber eyes determined. She looks around from side to side, before winking and adding,
		"And you know PNAME... It's been a while. I think it's time to.. Lift my self-imposed ban on consumption. Maybe loosen up and try some new things? It isn't too late... Hm. In any case."
		After a deep, respectful bow, Vala smiles at you.
		"Speaking this out loud, it helped me figure out my thoughts for the first time. Thank you. For listening."

		Letting go, Vala slumps to the ground, staring at her mother's sword. She sits sobbing slightly. You've never heard her speak this much. Her prolonged silence is deafening, but you know that she has a lot to think about. She'll get through it. Vala sits, deep in thought for almost half an hour, looking between you and the ground. Tears long dried. Almost whispering, she speaks.
		"..Do you think anyone can actually change PNAME? Is there a point of no return?."
		She frowns, still debating something within herself.
		"Can I make friends again? Will they accept me anymore..? ..Am I already doomed to die alone?"
		Shaking her head, she stands, showing her mother's sword to you. She points to some foreign writing inscribed on the scabbard.
		"Overcome yourself. That's what it says. Whether it was either of my mothers or some other long dead that wrote it, I don't know. But this mantra was hammered into me. Every failure, every success. It's all I have left, besides memories. Maybe.. Mother was the one who couldn't overcome anything. That's why she became like that. I suppose... I just have to believe in it. Become greater than she ever was. No more regrets. I just have to believe she wanted me to stay strong, whatever I'm faced with, including losing her."

		Righting her posture and dusting off her clothes, Vala nods towards you.
		"PNAME. I thank you for the respect you have shown me by calmly listening to this outburst. Unexpected from a simple question I'm sure."
		Vala chuckles quietly, looking somewhat ashamed of the whole thing.
		"My journey with you is the first step of many. I'll continue to fight with you, for as long as needed. I've still got some thoughts to sort out, but I'll try to be more open from now on. Without moving forward, I really will never change. I can't be afraid of my own people, or who I am, any longer."

		She ponders where to begin, blushing a little.
		"Our libidos are extremely high, it takes considerable willpower to resist any base desires when we're horny. Even the most resistant can turn into a gluttonous sex-crazed beast. We can get a bit uhm.. Unreasonable. Not really think about the consequences of our actions.. A lot of the time this ends up with someone gushed or gurgled, but it's commonplace and thought nothing of within our tribe. It's certainly no crime." 
		She crosses her arms eying you up and down for a moment.
		"To be honest with you, I turned you away when first we met. Because I didn't trust myself. You looked so innocent and out of place. It would have been easy to just... You know."
		With a nervous glace, she mimes a grabbing and gulping motion.

This leads to everyone trying to trap or trick each other with gambles, dares, wordplay, that sort of thing. Unsavvy women don't last long, sharp wit is our greatest asset. Well second greatest, if you ask anyone else."
		Vala uses both of her arms to gesture a comically large backside over her more petite one.
		"I've warned you before, but those girls are sly. Accept any offers, you'd better be sure there's no way they can twist it into something untoward. Unless that's what you expected, I suppose."

Sooner or later. The ones that do leave from her place always look so satisfied..."
		Vala's blush deepens and her eyes glaze over somewhat, but she suddenly pulls on one of her ears and shakes her head. With a sad little laugh she continues. 
		"See what I mean? A simple thought and I was just about ready to break. Mother taught me to pull on my ear to clear my head of dirty thoughts. It works well enough. ..Anyway, we should probably get going. A good sweat is what I need to take my mind off of stuff like churning and cumming."

		"When I think of what so easily could have been, it's hard to believe my species special at all. Let alone blessed by a greater power." 
		Vala stares at the sword for a minute or two. She suddenly gasps with realisation. 
		"Oh! Sorry PNAME. You asked me about the priestess, and here I am, blathering on again. You could ask Mother Shanna herself whatever it is you seek. I usually tried to stay away from her."

		Vala nods in agreement. 
		"As I thought. Does Shanna really expect me to believe that 'great ancestral spirits' are content with our village's tiny existence? That they protect us, when so many people's lives are lost, and without reasonable explanation?" 
		She raises her voice as she continues. 
		"Maybe she's just an old-fashioned hag that only spreads lies to keep herself on top! Her vast 'knowledge' is nothing but a fabricated.. Web of deceit..!!" 
		Trailing off, she looks at her feet and sighs.
		"Is what I'd like to say.. But there's no proof either way. And.. If everyone else believes in her, then that makes me the strange one, right? Mother always listened to her. She listened all the way to the grave..!" 
		Shaking her head frustratedly, the elven woman walks off. It seems that rather than disbelieving in their religion, Vala is hung up with what happened to her mother, still angry at the priestess.

		"There is so much I don't understand. If your arrival here has taught me anything, it's that." 
		Tapping her chin, she paces back and forth a little.
		"There could be spirits, certainly.. But even still, it's hard to believe that they bless and protect us. Ancestors or not." 
		She shrugs. 
		"In time.. Could we prove it to be false? Or perhaps.. Something turns up that makes our religion, and in turn, our steadfast belief in Mother Shanna, undeniably true?"

		"Though.. I often wonder just how she could have concocted the formula for such things. Through many failed experiments, most likely.. If I was more sociable, I'd just ask her. But I hear she's extremely secretive. And people who snoop around tend to go missing."

		"Neri was in that rival group. One of the only survivors from that day, too." 
		She looks away from you, blushing deeper. 
		"I was very nearly eaten by her in that struggle. Elbow deep in her shaft at one point, actually. I managed to yank my arm out, and thrust one of her friend's heads in instead. Paying no mind that it was her friend, she happily slurped her down.." 
		Vala was panting slightly, green skin dyed as red as it could be. 
		"At that point, the battle pretty much stopped for me. I could only watch and not pay much more attention. Watch as she reduced her own teammate, possibly friend, to jizz. The struggling bulge stop moving.. Losing definition.. It was so close to being me..."

With two left on either side, and everyone being full, we ended up calling off the feud. I don't know if you've met her, but Minyos's current champion was my old leader." 
		Vala shook her head again.
		"It seems from then on, Neri decided to treat me as 'the one that got away'. She was scared off by my mother, but after Mother didn't come back.. Neri began her advances. Pestering me when I went out, coming over unannounced, returning no matter how many times I denied her or threw her out. And well.. She was wearing me down. It's hard to forget that sensation.. The warm flesh slowly suckling.. That night, how close I was to being nothing but a load.. I confess, I still think of it to this day. If not for you, then I.."

Not feeling much any more, with your last thoughts, you can't help but be pleased at how much joy you've just given out. It only cost you the low price of your entire body. The enraptured elven woman doesn't even notice your passing, the sloshing of her belly slowly dying down. Her movements become laboured as her repeated ecstasies end, the tides of her stomach soon lulling her to a peaceful sleep.

A few more meals like that and she'll be just as huge as the other girls from her village. Now in a much more lucid, if still dazed state, she panics and wonders what she'll do from here on out.

		Recognising the willpower it must be taking Vala to eat you this slowly, you're impressed. She can't hold out for much longer though, and with a series of jerking motions, she gulps with much more strength, bringing you almost eye to eye with her in seconds. Giggling, you duck down and plant a kiss on her forehead. She raises her eyebrows in surprise, flushing deeply and finishing you off completely. You wiggle on the way down, with great effect, if the happy noises that Vala then makes are any indication. Tucking yourself away in the much less violent this time around stomach, you rub the inside linings and struggle against her gently, stimulating the organ somewhat. Acid tingles your extremities, but it looks like Vala wants to keep you as long as she possibly can this time.

		You and Vala have some mild conversation, discussing battle tactics and explaining technology, while you gradually dissolve inside the warm pit. Vala eventually falls into a food-induced coma, while you continue to stimulate her insides to give her pleasant dreams. It takes almost 2 hours before you can't think well enough to hold a proper train of thought together, and not long after that, your fibers can't hold your body together anymore either. You drift off satisfied, last thoughts wondering what changes you'll make, whilst Vala, still asleep, cradles her swollen belly like a perverse body pillow. The protein rich mush you made soon filters out, to be absorbed and futher pad out the elven warrior's body.

		She strides over to you, giving you what you assume is a salute, a faint smile on her lips. "Excellent. I am Vala. I look forward to fighting with you outsider. I wish to learn many things and staying in this village is driving me insane." She still seems rather jumpy, but her posture relaxes slightly, relief showing on her face. It seems to have taken a lot of courage to ask you to party up. She straightens and holds out a hand.
		"Ah, forgive me. For the pointless chatter. What is your name?"

		At your curt reply, Vala nods. "I see. PNAME. I will not demand this of you, but let us keep this a purely business partnership. It would pain me to grow close to someone who could soon be fat or waste."
		She pauses solemnly, closing her eyes, though even still her ears continue to twitch alertly.
		"It is dangerous in the wilderness and as you may have surmised, there is greater danger within the village. Be wary, many of us are sly. They have no qualms in consuming whatever they can." As Vala walks past you towards the exit, you notice her tug quite hard on one of her ears.

			Vala bows her head, fire lighting in her eyes "I am grateful to accompany you once more. Let us be on our way."
