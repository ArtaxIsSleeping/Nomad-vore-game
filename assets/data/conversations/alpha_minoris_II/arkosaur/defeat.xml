			As you look down on the defeated creature, a devious idea pops into your head.
			These creatures are quite bovine-like despite being lizards. Perhaps you could
			use it's tendacy to charge into things head-first to your advantage. With a smirk,
			you turn around while still facing the creature. You shake your <macro ID="butt_size_desc"/> rear-end
			at it, to which it responds with a annoyed snort. With a laugh, you give your <macro ID="butt_size_desc"/> a good
			slap, pushing the reptile's patience to an end. The weak, but angry arkosaur finally stands up and charges head-first towards your ass.
			You use both hands to spread your ass cheeks as wide as you can to prepare for the impact.

			The arkosaur rams its head right into your waiting anus. The sudden push causes you to jump a little, but not enough
			to dislodge the retile's head from your ass. The slow-minded creature still does not realize that it has been tricked
			and continues to push forward, right into your digestive system. With a statisfied moan, you spread your cheeks wider
			to accomidate for the creature's wide body. With a loud "schlorp" you hungry pucker sucks in the arkosaur's front legs.
			With it's legs no longer touching the ground, the arkosaur seems to finally realize that is has made a mistake, not that
			it can do anything about it. As your vorcarious backside continues to eat up the large reptile, you get down on all fours
			in a doggy style position to support the heavy weight entering your stomach.

			As you stomach begins to fill with reptile meat you,look behind yourself to your rear end sucking in the creature's
			back legs. With your stomach filling up underneath you, it is not long before your belly starts to lift the rest of your body off
			the ground. With one last pull, your asshole sucks in the beast's tail, sealing its fate inside your ass. Resting on top
			of your lizard-filled belly, you look at your surroundings to see other arkosaurs in the distance. The simple-minded creatures
			probably have no idea what has happened to their friend, but if they do understand, you've certaintly sent them a message.
			You take a quick nap to let your meal digest. When you wake up, your belly has shrunken down to size similar to a middle
			stage pregnancy. You give your belly a rub as you stand back to venture forth.
