	<description>The Harpy is slick with water or at the very least watery fluid. Not wearing a scrap of clothing her luscious curves are bared on full display and gleam. Her platinum hair is also practically radiant, those long strands spilling over her back, shoulders and the curves of her breasts. She runs her grey feathered wings through the water contently. She's clearly as at home here as an avian could ever be and then some.</description>
