<name>mushroom girl</name>
<description>

A short, female figure with pale grey skin and a bright reddish cap in place of hair.
Between four and five feet at best and resembling a human appearance, the smile the mushroom girl throws at you is truly heart-warming.
Young, innocent eyes look over your body, and a slight blush appears on her cheeks as she takes in your form.
LBREAK
Allowing your eyes to look over her in return, you notice slim, smooth calves and thighs, girly hips and a cute, firm butt, longing for the touch of your hands.
Moving upwards, your sight takes in a flat stomach and slender waistline.
Small, pert breasts curiously peek out from the cover of her raised arms, crossed protectively over her chest, as the soft lips of the girl nibble on one of her fingers.
LBREAK
When you finally meet her gaze, the grey-skinned girl bats her eyelashes at you, bashfully turning away to hide her blush behind her red mushroom cap.
