	Ptah, a mighty synthoid jackal on the desert world of Forakis, requires your help to repair her body. She requires her arm to be returned from the north east of the world where it was removed by the terror birds who guard the oasis. She also needs her leg to be returned from the liongirls at their outpost to the south west. Finally she needs for you to seize a power core from her black guardian sisters in the pyramid beyond the dangerous desert, this last location lies to the south east.
