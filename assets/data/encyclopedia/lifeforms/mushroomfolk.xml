		description:
		The more common form is a petite greyskinned but fundamentally flesh and
		blood humanoid with her hair replaced with a helmetlike red 'cap' of
		spongey material.
		LBREAK
		biological findings: The 'cap' appears to be a complicated mass of folded and
		ridged material that act to manufacture a form of 'omni-pheremone'
		capable of weakening will and increasing arousal in a wide variety of
		creatures. Further analysis of the pheremone samples reveals spore
		like airborne particles, however these particles are sterile and while
		clearly a form of reproduction this form of mushroom folk is clearly
		sterile. Coupled with the suppressant pheremones accumulated in the
		subject's biology this may lead to the conjecture that a more advanced
		form of mushroom folk will arise in any location where no other
		evolved form is present. So long as a subject has enough nutrients to
		actualize the costly transformation that is. This advanced form would
		certainly be capable of reproduction as well as suppressing the
		metamorphosis of nearby shroomfolk. this mushroom mother or queen
		would secrete fertile spores that would form mushroom girls when
		coming to rest in suitable locations.
		LBREAK
		Tactical assessment: The physical threat from the shroom folk is minimal with
		their diminutive stature, slender frames and limited muscle mass. The
		real threat comes from their ability to project pheremones at a target
		in order to bring that target into a state of self submission where
		they can devour them. their soft naked forms are probably vulnerable
		to all knowns forms of attack and their naive and immature
		personalities may leave them with little will to resist more esoteric
		forms of 'assault'.
