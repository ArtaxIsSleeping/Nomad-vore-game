	<name>BrightFeather</name>
	<description>A clean and well groomed harpy, her skin unmarred, her
		feathers bright and straight. Her blonde hair is bound with crude ties
		into locks to keep it manageable despite its length. Other than these
		ties she wears not a scrap of clothing leaving her tall and part avian
		form on full display. Though you can see her eyeing you with more
		consideration and calculation than you've seen in the eyes of the
		harpies down below.</description>
