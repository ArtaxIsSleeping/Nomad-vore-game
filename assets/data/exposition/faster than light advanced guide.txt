This guide will extol the benefits of higher powered space warping technology and provide navigational advice. LBREAK
When initiating warp it is important to recognize the effect of your Gravitational Stress Index on your attempt to warp. GSI makes it more difficult to form a warp bubble resulting in significantly higher energy costs and longer charge times. You can reduce this effect through more powerful engines which can more efficiently overcome gravitational stress. If you do not wish to invest in additional space warping engines however you can also reduce GSI by travelling further away from the star. However you are well advised to seek additional engines or more powerful engines to reduce fuel consumption and to reduce your overral flight time between stars LBREAK
