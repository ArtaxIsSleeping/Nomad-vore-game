	Jehari turns around when you get her attention "Ah! you're back, yes?" she pauses a moment then nods "Yes, you're back. Sorry sometimes it's hard to keep things straight. What can I do for you today?"

	The reptile taur is contemplatively musing to herself, seemingly deep in consideration of..something on her datapad only to look up saying something inscrutably technical to herself and darting over to a scanner and from there shortly to rummage in a cabinet all without noticing your presence. Just about the time you were starting to wonder whether it was a good idea to disturb her though she seems to catch a glimpse of you out of the corner of her eye and lets out a startled mip, the heavy taur jumping in surprise "Oh! I didn't see you there...you, how long have you been standing there, you didn't see me...no you don't look like you did. Uh, why are you here?"

	"Oh, oh well I suppose it is..not just that. Mostly it's my lab, but Frei says I need to pay for a place on this level. So yes, i sell things, that makes this is a shop right? probably. Are you interested in being sold things?" she cants her head to the side.

	"I told you my name is Jehari already didn't I?" she says at that, then blinks "I didn't...did I? sorry. My name is Jehari, and yes I'm a valk, don't worry I'm REALLY harmless." she says forestalling a reaction that she's apparently gotten before "It's a pleasure to meet you." she says doing a sorta half bow half bob down then up again.

	"Oh well, I suppose I am here. Not much to say. I was decanted defective and slated for liquidation. I can't fight you see, it's why I'm so glad for the wardens. Anyway I found a way of getting to an escape pod and i was picked up by some nice girls who dropped me off here. And I've been here ever since, Frei got me a lab once she realized the sorta mind I had."

	"You don't know? oh, I suppose you might not. My people are all grown in vats, we were originally meant to be soldiers for our makers but they were seemingly all reduced to less than full sapience by the plague so we had to create our own leaders and goals with no one to tell us what to do. I think we mostly lack imagination though, fighting and conquering was what we were doing before we were free."
