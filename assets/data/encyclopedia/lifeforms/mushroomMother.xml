		Description: LBREAK
		The Mother was clearly an advanced form of mushroom-girl,
		serving as their matron.
		LBREAK
		Biological findings: LBREAK
		The role of the mushroom Mother appears to be twofold:
		she must both produce fertile spores, which shall grow
		into the more common, infertile variety of mushroom girl,
		and she must also produce a constant, steady supply of
		huge quantities of milk for the others to rely on in times
		of starvation. The former appears to be assisted
		by the larger size of her cap, while the latter role seems
		to be aided by a biological capability to ingest whole
		creatures through her nipples. It should also be noted
		that the increased mass of her body stems more from her
		age and caste than her metabolic intake, though the latter
		cannot wholly be discounted.
		LBREAK
		Tactical assessment: LBREAK
		Though the Mother's increased mass over the common variety
		of mushroom-girl would provide her an edge in physical combat
		and present a tangible threat, it is clear that, like the
		common varieties, pheromonal discharge is the preferred means
		of attack. This bevahior might be a holdover from a previous,
		less bulky stage of development. The pheromones of this caste
		are notably more powerful than those of the common mushroom
		girl, so one should take care to mitigate their effect. However,
		as large as Mothers grow, this makes them much bigger targets
		for physical assault.
