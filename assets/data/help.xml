Your health bar (red, topmost) is your resistance to being taken as unwilling prey or otherwise meeting a terrible fate. Healing items are useful for recovery. LBREAK 
Your resolve bar (pink, below) is your resistance to becoming willing prey. LBREAK 
your satiation bar (green, lowest) inversely represents your level of hunger, and is constantly depleting as you need food in order to live. LBREAK

when your resolve is less than total it automatically recovers regardless of your satiation level LBREAK
when your satiation level reaches 0 you will begin to rapidly take starvation damage LBREAK
