Log: thank fuck harpies don't have fingers. I think i'm safe here for now. Goddamn moon's a death trap though, sooner I'm away from here the better.
Which brings me to the fact that while the engines for this shuttle look intact much of the interior's been stripped. Maybe someone was doing a bit of salvaging and got interrupted before they could finish, considering what I dodged on the way here I can bloody well guess how that happened. Anyway, ship lacks a navigation console. Without it I can't control the engines, and without control of the engines I can't take off. I might be able to scrounge up some electronics north of here, I saw some ruins and I can only hope they're advanced enough to contain some computer parts. And if I'm really lucky there'll be no harpies there swooping at my head crotch first.
