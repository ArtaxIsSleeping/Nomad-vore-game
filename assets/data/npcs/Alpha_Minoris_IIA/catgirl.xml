<description>
A kitty girl barely five feet tall, pale skinned but with her face and arms reddened by a tan. Her head crowned with a pair of reddish furr'd kitty ears and her butt adorned with a cute tail equally furry and often aswish. She's clad in a louse blouse and an earth toned skirt. Perhaps she works here?
