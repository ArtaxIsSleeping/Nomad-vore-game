The wolfgirl Erika gulps one final time and the feet and tailtips protruding from her lips vanish past them. A bulge visible in her neck that swiftly disappears down to join the rest in her meal. The wolf's belly spilling out massive, bloated and bulging with the furiously squirming shape of the fox demi within. Erika wipes her lips.
</text>
<text>
Erika's gut jostles and bobs, muffled yelps and pleas to be let out audible emanating from that bulging belly.
</text>
<text>
Erika's belly pushes outwards with hand prints as poor Mallory tries to escape her fate.
</text>
<text>
The foxgirl trapped in Erika's gut lets out a protesting 'let me out, i can get the money' pushing her hands out against the inside of Erika's gut making nice hand bulges.
</text>
<text>
Erika's gut gurgles and glorps loudly around the foxy, squeezing on her meal and kneading at her from all sides.
</text>
<text>
The foxgirl shoves a hand out against the tummy walls, then a gurgling burbling clench squeezes her and forces her handbulge back in.
</text>
<text>
Erika's belly bulge is starting to lose definition, the contours of the foxgirl a bit harder to discern amidst the curves of that taut and bloated tum.
</text>
<text>
The foxy lets out a squeel of protest that ends in a gurgling noise, making that belly jostle and bob on the wolfy.
</text>
<text>
Erika's belly lets out a weak whimpering noise as it rounds out further, won't be long now.
</text>
<text>
Erika's meal is progressing closer to being absolutely digested now, barely moving around or making noises other than gurgles and glorps.
</text>
<text>
Erika lets out a hearty burp as her meal breaks down entirely, her gut clenching and contracting to show off the softened rounded mass that it now contains.
