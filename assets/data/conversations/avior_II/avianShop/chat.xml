	"Oh? OH! a newt? with like..a tongue..and, lurking? as in sneaking. My that sounds dangerous, but the point is you got rid of it. Good. that is, very..very good. Can't have a newt eating all of Brightfeather's family..that would be very bad. Thankyou for getting rid of it." says Keliya with a smile "Now that the area is safe we could make it more comfortable for Brightfeather's friends maybe."

	Keliya chirps "I guess they're kinda family to her. But we can't have a bunch of feral harpies in our village. We'll need to find somewhere else for them to make their nests." says the harpy storekeep, bobbing as she thinks in a way that's probably normal for her but a bit disorientating for you.

	"We need to find somewhere else for them to live. And by we, I really mean you. I need to mind the store and I'm really not the exploring and adventuring type. But could you go and see if the area south west of the village is safe for harpies? I mean, I'm sure it is. but could you go check it out and make sure?"

	Keliya nods "Yes yes, sufferers of the plague. Very sad, though perhaps they are happy as they are? But that's what's sad, they don't know any better. Can't know anything better." she says and then chirps and cants her head to the side "We can all talk here though, you don't need to worry...though there are ferals elsewhere on the planet...so be careful..but you really don't need to fear much in the village!" she insists.

	Keliya pauses "How?" she says and then continues "I mean, I don't know why she'd be unaffected when the others are feral cause of the plague? Nevermind. What's important is she is lonely, the affection of ferals of your own kind probably isn't much comfort. I wouldn't know of course, but I heard..somewhere..anyway, the flock agrees that for someone not a member of the flock you're an alright sort. Perhaps you could act as our agent in this affair...would you, deliver to her an invitation on our behalf?"
