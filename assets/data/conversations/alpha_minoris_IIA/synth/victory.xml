	"Prepare for containment valued customer." the synth commands as she reaches down to grasp your head firmly with both hands and guides it willing or not towards her netherlips. Those emulated sex lips realistic, moist and as it happens fully function as the gynoid forces you facefirst into her snatch. Lewd squeelches audible as her juices soak your head and she wedges you in down to your neck in one movement "As you can tell Omnico has put a lot of work into emulating the experience of being taken and forced into a womb." the synth comments and continues handling you to feed in your shoulders, her insides are hot and welcoming. And she's right, that womb of hers is remarkably soft and accomodating, definitely realistic.

	The synth continues cramming you inside. Her hands methodically moving down your flanks and each time they grasp you they haul you deeper inside, cramming your upper body up between her legs. Her womb stretching easily to accomodate you, her midriff distending as you're curled and crammed into that fleshy prison. Once she reaches your thighs though she straightens up, and draws you inside using nothing more than her clenching and potent pussy wrapped around your legs "Submit to my womb valued customer, your satisfaction is our greatest concern."

	You're not sure how being trapped in a womb is supposed to make you a satisfied customer but you doubt the Synth is paying much attention to your protests as she reaches one hand down to fondle her snatch just above where it stretches around your disappearing legs. Your feet kicking about as they get closer and closer to her domed out middle. Most of you is already confined in the snuggley warm prison of her womb. And soon all of you is imprisoned within the synth's body as your feet are slurped between her netherlips "Valued customer, please take the time to experience thoroughly the synthoid womb product before providing feedback." the synth continues, her voice as ever normal and untroubled even after shoving you bodily into her drooling snatch.

	Yeah no your customer experience has not been satisfactory and you push off against her insides to try and force your way back out of this deranged gynoid. The synth's womb proving soft, yielding and slick which makes your efforts a little tricky. But you're not to be deterred by a comfy prison and some marketspeak and persist, tipping yourself upside down in order to push off against the inside of the womb and thrust yourself back out through her nethers into the open air "error, customer is attempting escape before trial period is concluded." she utters robotically as she clenches to try and force you back inside, but to no avail as you're well beyond the point of being easily subdued. Instead of going back inside you wriggle the rest of the way out leaving the synth looking confused in that blank eyed mechanized way of any machine with no quick answer to what just happened. Still you should probably get clear before she resets and shoves you back inside, you might not be so lucky next time.

	You want out of here so you can write a scathing yelp review or something and so you shove at the insides of the womb in search of the way out, it's the way you came in so it shouldn't be too hard to find. You press your fingers against the entrance of her synthoid birth canal and shove off against the inside of the womb. Only to find yourself slipping, tumbling unruly inside her. You don't give up though and continue your efforts to escape despite the difficulty. The synth resting a hand against the dome of her middle as you tire yourself out inside of her "error, customer actions do not complete...error" she hesitates a moment with a stutter of resetting relays then smiles "thankyou for selecting extended stay as your chosen option, we hope you have a pleasant entrapment." she announces, and you groan. Great you're tired and now set for a long stay as you somehow triggered a different protocol...

	The synth walks around unmindful of the burden she's carrying. You're forced to endure this prolonged stay as her prisoner, tightly smuggled away in her distended middle as the gynoid seems to go around doing nothing in particular. She'll walk around purely to walk around and then pat and rub now and then against where you're confined, but mostly she seems to be reinforcing your powerlessness to act by doing things. Eventually after a seemingly endless period of torpor inside her you feel her come to a halt and announce "we hope you have enjoyed this prolonged stay within the womb of an Omnico synthetic predator gynoid version 42." she rattles off and settles down into a seated position, spreading her thighs as she clenches down and sets about rebirthing you into the world. slick gynoid juices coating your form as you emerge inch by inch from between her legs until with a final schlorp your feet pop free and you lie there free once more "please fill out a customer feedback questionaire at the information office." she says placing a towel next to you afore stepping away seemingly done with you.

	The synth smiles "We hope you enjoy this enwombing experience." the gynoid reiterates as she sets about wandering around, demonstrating her ability to handle the weight of your body inside her womb. Your form is nicely cradled by the fleshy confines of her soft womb as she goes about her business and dotes upon her bulge now and then with pats and rubs. When the time comes though your stay comes to an end as she settles down into a seated position and starts to ease you out of herself. slick gynoid juices coating your form as you emerge inch by inch from between her legs until with a final schlorp your feet pop free and you lie there free once more "please fill out a customer feedback questionaire at the information office." she says placing a towel next to you afore stepping away seemingly done with you.

			and pleasant as possible." she explains afore her jaws ratchet open
			wide. Moist air wafting out as the synthetic woman shows off her gape
			afore setting about devouring you, engulfing your head and cramming
			it inside. The warm fluids oozing around you as that throat stretches
			and undulates, smoothly swelling around your head and gripping it to
			draw you inside. They really did put a lot of effort into making it

			The synth holds you aloft as she devours you, her slender form holding
			surprising strength. Your legs squirm or flail around uselessly,
			hanging in the air as she chugs you down. Her tongue carefully
			tasting over you thoroughly, leaving you coated in artificial saliva
			as you slide on down. Your head plunging down past her esophagus, her
			gut steamy hot and wet and easily stretching as you're fed in. You
			hear her moan around your middle and then waistline as she engulfs
			more of you. Her hands stroking possessively over her gut as it
			swells out. Your form starting to curl inside the prison of her belly
			as it pushes out with your contours.

			calves, then finally flexing hard around your ankles as she swallows
			a final time. The synth gobbling you down and sealing her jaws up
			past your feet with a snap, mhmming appreciatively and reaching down
			to rub over her belly and utters satisfied lipsmacks "You were
			delicious customer." she says, her gut sagging down with your weight
			now you're curled up within the tightness of her belly, trapped
			inside the synth's containing gut.

			You're not about to stay around being carried around as a belly pet by a

			arms afore trying to push down on the top of her belly with both
			hands firmly. The synth protesting your lack of acquiescence "please
			calm down ma'am, trying to get out prematurely will only harm your
			customer experience." she says, not deterred however you shove your
			way up, finally finding the entrance to her throat and worming your
			hands up and out. The synth stumbling as her jaws are forced apart
			and your fingers grasp at the flanks of her lips. With the grip you
			can easily pull your way out despite her protests, the gynoid
			stumbling and flailing and falling on her but as you work your upper
			body past her jaws, then flop out onto the ground and wriggle free.
			It's undignified, but you've gotten free.

			"Enjoy yourself customer, we hope you find your experience to your liking."

			Occasionally she'd pause to reach down and snug her massively
			distended gut with both hands, cradling the bulges of your form

			horking you up. Her insides efficiently pressing around you and
			pushing you up and out of her body. Emerging headfirst from her mouth
			you find her hands waiting for you, supporting you until she can
			grasp under your arms and help ease you out of her throat entirely.
			The synth setting you down on the floor with a bright smile "please
			take the time to fill out a customer satisfaction survey." she says
