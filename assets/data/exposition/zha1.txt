..how could it be that these murals feature only these strange figures, they are clearly not Quendi. I had thought it an anomaly, but in all places these strange beings are depicted acting as people. They are not some forgotten spirit or monsters of mythos but beings who build, work and worship in the murals. Could it be this place was not built by our foremothers? if so why are we never mentioned or depicted? unless, unless there were no Quendi when these walls were inscribed.
