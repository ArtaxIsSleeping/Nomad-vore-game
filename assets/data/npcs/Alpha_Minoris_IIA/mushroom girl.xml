	<name>mushroom girl</name>
	<description>

		A short, female humanoid with gainsboro skin and a bright red cap in
		place of hair, standing somewhere between four and five feet tall. The
		smile she throws at you is truly heart-warming, performed with her bright,
		innocent eyes just as much as with her mouth. As said eyes saunter down your
		body, a blush appears on her cheeks.
		LBREAK
		Taking the opportunity to look over her in return, you notice slim, smooth calves
		and thighs; girly hips; and a cute, firm butt, longing for the touch of
		your hands. Moving upwards, you take in a flat stomach and a slender waistline,
		above which small, pert breasts curiously peek out from the under cover of her 
		arms, protectively crossed over her chest. She nibbles on her fingers, cheeks
		still brightly flushed.
		LBREAK
		When you finally meet her gaze, the ash-gray girl bats her eyelashes
		at you, bashfully turning away to hide her blush behind her red
		mushroom cap. And as she does so, you notice a thin, gray mist
		falling from her cap.
