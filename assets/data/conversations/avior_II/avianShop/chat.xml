	"Hello again friendly trading partner, what can I do for you today?" Keliya bobs and smiles encouragingly.

	Keliya nods "Yes yes, sufferers of the plague. Very sad, though perhaps they are happy as they are? But that's what's sad, they don't know any better. Can't know anything better." she says and then chirps and cants her head to the side "We can all talk here though, you don't need to worry...though there are feral harpies elsewhere on the planet...so be careful..but you really don't need to fear much in the village!" she insists.

	Keliya pauses "How?" she says and then continues "I mean, I don't know why she'd be unaffected when the others are feral cause of the plague? Nevermind. What's important is she is lonely, the affection of ferals of your own kind probably isn't much comfort. I wouldn't know of course, but I heard..somewhere..anyway, the flock agrees that for someone not a member of the flock you're an alright sort. Perhaps you could act as our agent in this affair...would you, deliver to her an invitation on our behalf?"

	"Good good, go..tell her she is welcome here if she wants to come. You might have to help arrange her transportation yourself though. We don't have our own ships." says Keliya with a smile and a happy little bob bob motion.

	"Oh, well..that's okay as well. I mean, I'm not upset or anything. We can still trade and stuff, but with you being who you are..and her being lonely, i thought..nevermind."

	"Hello I am Keliya, welcome to my shop. It's a friendly shop, focused on friendly trading, absolutely not gushings." she says with a seemingly subconscious headbob.

	"Because some people are lying about us here! they act like if you come to visit you'll have a harpy swoop down on you out of nowhere to cram you up between her legs and turn you into a puddle. Do you have any idea how hard it is to get customers? I mean...okay it happens sometimes, but not all the time. And I'm not going to gush you so it's okay!"
