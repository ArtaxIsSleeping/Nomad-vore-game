	<description>
	This pale skinned gynoid has obvious signs of artificiality in her joints and glowing blue eyes but is a remarkable accomplishment in verisimilitude. Her body looks soft and pert, with a rounded ass, shapely breasts and..a prodigious and very authentic looking cock. All of this is on display as she's not wearing a stitch of clothing. Her ass length green hair doesn't really serve to hide much of her authentic attributes.
